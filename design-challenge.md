# Onyo Design Challenge #

The main goal of the challenge is to create a UI prototype of a Mobile Application, keeping in mind:
# Accessibility
# The best user expirience
# Difference between plataforms (Android and iOS)
# Mobile platforms design guidelines (Apple Design Guidelines and Google Material Design)
# Beautiful screens 

## Problem Description ##

The app has basically one feature that is show Places informations.
It must have the following features:
* Show list of Places
* Allow the user to search on the list
* Show the details of one Place

Each place has the following informations:
* Name
* Address
* Distance from current user location
* Phone
* Short Description
* Long Description
* Image

You should worry with:
* Pretty long names
* Places that don`t have images
* Different screen sizes
* The app could not be able to retreive user location
* Conform to Onyo branding

You should not worry about:
* Image format and presentation (it could be a square, rectangle, triangle or even a dodecagon)
* Image proportions (you can assume that it will come in the proportions you choose)
* You can choose which information will appear on the list and on detail screen, based on user experience
