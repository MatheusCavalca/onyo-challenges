# Onyo Design Challenge #

The main goal of the challenge is to create a UI prototype of a Mobile Application, keeping in mind:
* Accessibility
* The best user expirience
* Difference between plataforms (Android and iOS)
* Mobile platforms design guidelines (Apple Design Guidelines and Google Material Design)
* Beautiful screens 

## Problem Description ##

The app has basically one feature that is show Places informations.
It must have the following features:
* Show list of Places
* Allow the user to search on the list
* Show the details of one Place

Each place has the following informations:
* Name
* Address
* Distance from current user location
* Phone
* Short Description
* Long Description
* Image

You should worry about:
* Pretty long names
* Places that don`t have images
* Different screen sizes
* Provide a good UX, even if itâ€™s unable to retrieve the user location, either for access restrictions or for lack of GPS signal.
* Conform to a restaurant brand of your choice.

You should not worry about:
* Image format and presentation (it could be a square, rectangle, triangle or even a dodecagon)
* Image proportions (you can assume that it will come in the proportions you choose)
* You can choose which information will appear on the list and on detail screen, based on user experience
